PROSE = {
    "Introduction": "Last-mile delivery is the most expensive leg of an e-commerce order, and cities make it harder through congestion, parking limits and short delivery windows [S1]. Routing software that learns from past deliveries is often proposed as a way to lower that cost without adding vehicles [S2]. This paper asks how far that promise holds in dense urban settings, and where the evidence is thin. It argues that learning-based routing lowers cost mainly by raising vehicle utilization, and that gains shrink once customer density falls [S3].",
    "Literature Review": "Reviews of the field separate classical optimization from machine learning approaches and note that the two are increasingly combined [S1]. Early work focused on how customer density and delivery windows shape route length, which remains the baseline against which newer methods are judged [S3]. Later studies use historical delivery data to predict travel times and service durations, then feed those predictions into the routing step [S2]. More recent surveys widen the scope to include drones and other vehicle types, and point out that evaluation methods differ so much that headline savings are hard to compare across studies [S5][S6].",
    "Analysis": "Across the sources, the strongest and most consistent mechanism is better use of vehicle capacity: fewer partly empty trips and shorter total distance [S2]. Density matters because consolidation is easier when many stops sit close together, which favors urban cores over rural areas [S3]. Sustainability reviews add that lower distance also reduces emissions, though they caution that rebound effects can offset part of the gain when faster delivery raises order volume [S6]. The evidence for real-time re-routing is weaker, mostly because few studies test it outside simulation [S4].",
    "Conclusion": "Learning-based route optimization can reduce last-mile cost in dense urban delivery, mainly through higher vehicle utilization [S2][S3]. The size of the benefit depends on customer density and on how the study was evaluated, so single savings figures should be read with care [S5]. Future work would benefit from shared benchmarks and field trials rather than simulation alone [S4].",
